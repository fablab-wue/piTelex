        Some things aren't in the specs, but were obtained by personal
        communication with i-Telex programmer Fred Sonnenrein. i-Telex does it
        like this:

        1. Depending on configuration, do self-test every 45 s (not too often
           because self test blocks other connections).
        2. If self-test fails, retry two times. On success, go to 1. If three
           consecutive self tests fail, continue.
        3. Trigger client_update to TNS and reset timer (see 6).
        4. If this yielded data, retry self-test at most three times. On
           success, go to 1. Continue otherwise.
        5. Log error and wait until client_update successful, in this case go
           to 1.
        6. The previous items nonwithstanding, retry client_update every 60
           min. If client_update is triggered elsewhere, reset timer.

        Modifications for piTelex, to KISS:

        - Run everything from single thread. Instead of precise timings, use
          sleep in-between calls.
        - Do self-test every 20 s (no problem as we don't block "real"
          clients), rinse and repeat. Retry up to six times on fail.
        - After first six fails, trigger client_update. Retry self-test another
          six times. If it fails another six times, stop self-tests and keep
          trying client_update. Restart self-tests if successful.
        - The only gap: If TNS updates don't succeed but self-tests do, there
          is no advance warning. If eventually the IP address changed and the TNS
          update still cannot be performed, the self test will fail and the
          problem will be noticed only then.
