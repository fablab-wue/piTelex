Service installation (tested on Raspbian buster):

1. Make sure byobu and screen are installed:

   sudo apt install byobu screen

2. Adapt pitelex.service to configure piTelex path (WorkingDirectory=,
   ExecStart=) and user (User=), if needed

3. Install service file:

   sudo cp pitelex.service /lib/systemd/system/

4. Execute on boot:

   sudo systemctl enable pitelex.service

5. Start service now:

   sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start pitelex.service

6. Test:

   systemctl status pitelex.service

   ... should say active (running).

   byobu-screen -list

   ... should show the piTelex session as "detached".

If everything worked, piTelex is now running transparently in the background.
Connect to the console at any time using

byobu-screen

Detach using F6, piTelex will continue to run.

Start, restart and stop piTelex using systemd service commands:

sudo systemctl <cmd> pitelex.service

Inside byobu, piTelex can also be terminated using CTRL-C, CTRL-C. The byobu
session will also quit. systemd will restart everything after 10 s.

NB: Depending on the modules/options you use, the service may need internet
access on start. On Raspberry Pi with Raspbian 10 (buster), this requires
enabling the following option in raspi-config additionally:

- 3 Boot Options
- B2 Wait for Network at Boot
