        #
        # Overview:
        # - i-Telex requires us to periodically send Acknowledge packets so
        #   that the sending party can determine how much of the sent data has
        #   been printed already. Its payload is an 8 bit monotonic counter of
        #   undefined reference point. It should however be 0 as soon as we're
        #   ready to receive and print data.
        #
        # - Basic function: We count data received from remote and subtract
        #   current printer buffer contents. Special care is taken to keep the
        #   counter monotonically increasing, which otherwise might happen if
        #   other modules than us also send data to the printer.

        # If we're server, use negative Acknowledge counter first to allow for
        # fixed-length welcome banner printing
        self._acknowledge_counter = self._last_acknowledge_counter = (-24 if is_server else 0) # fixed length of welcome banner, see txDevMCP

        # The rationale here is to, after starting the printer, first print the
        # complete welcome banner. Received data must only by printed *after*
        # this.
        #
        # The typical sequence is as follows:
        #
        # - After printable data is received for the first time, we decide on
        #   the connection type (Baudot or ASCII), queue some commands (start
        #   printer, MCP output welcome banner) and also queue the received
        #   data afterwards. (state 2)
        #
        # - Main loop read()-s us. Our read method is filtered (based on state
        #   2) so that only commands are read, printable data is retained for
        #   later perusal.
        #
        # - Eventually, MCP receives the welcome banner command. It sends the
        #   banner, which is writ[e]()-ten to us. After the banner, it sends
        #   the ESC-WELCOME command which tells us the banner has been written
        #   completely. On this command, our read method is unlocked and
        #   previously received data is available for main loop. (state 4)

        #
        # 1. SHOULDN'T be sent before either Direct Dial or Baudot Data have
        #    been received once (only if we're being called)
        # 2. SHOULDN'T be sent before printer is started
        # 3. MUST be sent once the teleprinter has been started
        #
        # No. 1 is achieved through self._connected; it is set to ST.CON_TP_REQ
        # once the condition is fulfilled.
        #
        # No. 2 is always fulfilled since the printer is started only after
        # condition 1, or is already running if we're the caller.
        #
        # No. 3 is handled as follows:
        # - Once the teleprinter's start confirmation is received, and No. 1 is
        #   fulfilled, the first Acknowledge is sent (only if we're being called).
        # - Acknowledge packets are sent with the number of printed characters
        #   as argument (self._received_counter - self.get_print_buf_len()) on the
        #   schedule below.
        #
        # The schedule is as follows. Basically, Acknowledge is sent if and
        # only if there are unprinted characters in the buffer, i.e.
        # self.get_print_buf_len() > 0, and is triggered by any one of the
        # following (as per spec):
        #
        # - After a 1 s sending break (NB we don't fulfil this exactly, but it
        #   should suffice)
        # - Acknowledge is received and sent_counter equals the packet's data
        #   field (i.e. the remote side has printed all sent characters)
        # - Baudot Data is received and self.get_print_buf_len() >= 16

        # What must teleprinter driver modules implement to enable proper
        # Acknowledge throttling?
        #
        # They should send the ESC-~ command in the following way:
        # - It must not be sent before the printer has been started
        # - It must be sent at least once when the printer has been started
        # - It should be sent about every 500 ms
        # - Payload is the current buffer length, i.e. the characters still
        #   waiting to be printed
